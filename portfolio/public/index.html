      content="Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a passionate and dedicated college student with a strong foundation in full stack web development. With a love for both front-end design and back-end logic, I strive to create seamless and user-friendly web applications. Throughout my academic journey, I’ve tackled a variety of projects, each helping me hone my skills in technologies like React, Node.js, MongoDB, and more.

      As an aspiring full stack developer, I am constantly exploring new tools and methodologies to stay ahead in this fast-paced field. My projects reflect my ability to translate ideas into functional, responsive, and visually appealing web applications. Whether it's building dynamic user interfaces or ensuring robust server-side functionality, I enjoy every step of the development process.
      
      I invite you to explore my portfolio, where you'll find a showcase of my latest work. Each project not only demonstrates my technical abilities but also my commitment to continuous learning and improvement. I’m excited to apply my skills in real-world scenarios and contribute to innovative web solutions.
      
      Let’s connect and build something amazing together!"

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
